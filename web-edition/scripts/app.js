const N_MAX = 10; // highest number expected

//determine which style of grid to use, based on screen dimensions
//1 - tall or wide: try for rows of 5 (anticipating 10 countables)
//2 - not all that tall/wide: use a square grid whenever possible.

//actually might be able to get CSS to handle cases matching 1: just set the width of
//the countables appropriately and the grid should handle the rest?
